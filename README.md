# 🧩 What Is a Wireframe?

A **wireframe** is like a simple drawing or sketch that shows the basic design of a website or app before it is built.

Imagine you're planning a house. Before building, you make a rough plan showing where the rooms, doors, and windows will go. A wireframe does the same thing—but for websites and apps. It shows where things like the menu, buttons, pictures, and text will appear on the screen.

It’s usually made with basic shapes like boxes and lines—no colors, no fancy designs—just a simple map of the layout.

# 🎯 Importance of Wireframes

Wireframes are important because they help us:

- ✅ **Plan** what a website or app will look like and how it will work.
- ✅ **Organize** ideas clearly, so nothing important is left out.
- ✅ **Save time and money** by fixing problems early before real design and coding begin.
- ✅ **Work together**: Designers, developers, and clients can all understand and agree on the plan before building.

# 🧱 Key Elements in a Wireframe

A wireframe is made up of different parts that help show how a website or app will work. Below are the most important elements you’ll find in a wireframe:


## 1. 📐 Layout Structure

This is the overall framework—the "skeleton" of the page. It shows how the screen is divided into sections (like the top, middle, and bottom).

🔸 **Example:** A homepage might have a layout with a header at the top, main content in the center, and a footer at the bottom.

💡 **Why it matters:** A clear structure helps users know where to find things easily.


## 2. 🧭 Navigation

These are the menus, links, or buttons that help users move from one part of the website or app to another.

🔸 **Example:** A menu bar at the top with links like "Home", "About", and "Contact".

💡 **Why it matters:** Good navigation makes it easy for users to explore the website without getting lost.


## 3. 📝 Content Placement

This shows where text, images, videos, or other information will appear on the page.

🔸 **Example:** A blog post wireframe might show a title at the top, an image below it, and the article text underneath.

💡 **Why it matters:** Organizing content clearly helps users understand the message quickly.


## 4. ⚙️ Functionality

This includes buttons, forms, search bars, and other parts that users can interact with.

🔸 **Example:** A wireframe for a login page might include fields for email and password, and a "Login" button.

💡 **Why it matters:** Showing these elements helps the team plan how users will use the site or app.


# 🧠 In Summary

Each wireframe element plays a role in creating a good experience for users. They work together to:
- Guide how the site is built
- Make sure nothing is missing
- Help everyone understand the design before it becomes real
