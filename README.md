# ðŸ§© What Is a Wireframe?

A **wireframe** is like a simple drawing or sketch that shows the basic design of a website or app before it is built.

Imagine you're planning a house. Before building, you make a rough plan showing where the rooms, doors, and windows will go. A wireframe does the same thingâ€”but for websites and apps. It shows where things like the menu, buttons, pictures, and text will appear on the screen.

Itâ€™s usually made with basic shapes like boxes and linesâ€”no colors, no fancy designsâ€”just a simple map of the layout.

# ðŸŽ¯ Importance of Wireframes

Wireframes are important because they help us:

- âœ… **Plan** what a website or app will look like and how it will work.
- âœ… **Organize** ideas clearly, so nothing important is left out.
- âœ… **Save time and money** by fixing problems early before real design and coding begin.
- âœ… **Work together**: Designers, developers, and clients can all understand and agree on the plan before building.
